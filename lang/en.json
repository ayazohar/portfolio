    "about-content": "Iâ€™m Aya Zohar, an artist based in Haifa, Israel. At 35, I primarily work with oils and watercolors, though I occasionally explore acrylics, spray paint, and other mediums. My education as an artist includes several painting courses with various teachers, complemented by a lot of self-guidance. I find inspiration mainly in the nature and animals around me. I look forward to sharing my work with you.",

    "sketches-content": "Giving has always played an important role in my art. Many of my paintings are dedicated to people dear to my heart, and the connection and love for these people instill in me the forces of life and creation. It took me time to share my sketches as well and to recognize the value in their unfinished quality. Today, I am more open to seeing the unexpected ways in which different works touch different people, and I share even raw, experimental, and preliminary works. The sketches in this section of the gallery are available as gifts, and if one of them catches your eye, feel free to write to me.",
